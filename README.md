## üöÄ Project Requirements

### Data Engineering & Analytics

#### Objective
To develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate retail sales data. The warehouse supports both data engineering tasks (ETL, data modeling, schema design) analytics and informed decision making (SQL queries, reporting tables, KPIs).

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Dataset is gotten from Kaggle consisting of six CSV files representing different aspects of retail sales (e.g., customers, sales transactions, products, etc.).
- **Data Quality**: Before integration, data cleansing will be performed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize formats, and ensure overall consistency.
- **Integration**: The six CSV files will be integrated into a unified SQL Server Data Warehouse through ETL processes, ensuring referential integrity and enabling consolidated reporting.
- **Scope**: The scope will focus on the latest dataset provided (CSV files from Kaggle), and historical updates beyond this dataset are out of scope.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support business stakeholders and analytics teams.

 ### Analytics & Reporting(Data Analytics)

 #### Objective
 Develop SQL based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
 - **Customer Behaviour**
 - **Product Performance**
 - **Sales Trends**

   These insights give key business metrics,thereby enabling strategic decision-making.

  ## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

  The Data Architecture for this project follows the Meddalion Architecture **Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layer**

  [drawio.drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22722878/drawio.drawio)

  The Medallion Architecture organizes data into three layers for better quality and accessibility:

  **1. Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data directly from source systems with no transformation applied. Data is ingested from CSV 
  files into SQL Server Database.

  **2. Silver Layer:** Includes cleansing, standardization, and normalization process preparing data for analysis and modeling.  

  **3. Gold Layer:** Houses aggregated, business-ready data structured in a star schema, optimized for analytics, dashboards, and reporting.


 üéØ As part of my journey in data analytics, this repository highlights my work using SQL to clean and analyze data.
    It reflects my growing expertise in transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
